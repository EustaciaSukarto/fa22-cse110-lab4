1. Variables num1 and num2 both contain string values so result = num1 + num2 returns a string which is a concatenation of num1 and num2 (the result of string addition between num1 and num2).
   
2. I would subtract both num1 and num2 by 0 (integer) so that num1 and num2 would map to their integer values. This way, both num1 and num2 will both be integers and result = num1 + num2 would return an integer which is the correct result of adding integers num1 and num2.
